          <b>Identifying room for improvement</b><br></br>
          The first version of Meet picture in picture had extremely low usage, but it was loved by those that did use it. Partnering with UXR, I identified a few key areas for improvement:
          </p>
      </div>
      <ChromeFeedback />


      

      <div className={styles.process}>

        <p>
          <b>Identifying key use cases</b><br></br>
I partnered with our amazing UXR to get feedback on what the key uses cases people were using pip for. This informed which features we should toggle on and prioritize in the UI.</p>

          <b>Partnering with Chrome to improve discoverability</b><br></br>
          We partnered with Chrome to trigger the picture in picture any time somebody navigates to a new tab within the same window. What we built in Meet is using all public APIs. We influence and give feedback, but don’t get special treatment. In order to create a strong partnership I focused on understanding their goals and constraints, so that I could be a teammate and advocate for them in Meet specific meetings.

None of the components we were using were designed to be very responsive. Since Chrome pip could get very small, and there are many combinations of things that could be happening at the same time, it got complicated.</p>
